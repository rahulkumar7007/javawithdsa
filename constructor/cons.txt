constructor 

Constructor
  Object creation is not enough, compulsorily we should perform initialization then
  only the object is in a position to provide the response properly.
  Whenever we are creating an object some piece of the code will be executed
  automatically to perform initialization of an object. This piece of code is nothing
  but a constructor.
  Main objective of the constructor is nothing but initialisation of Object.
